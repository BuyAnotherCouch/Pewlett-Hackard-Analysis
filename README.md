# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to assist Bobby, an HR Analyst at Pewlett Hackard, in providing the following information to his manager:

-	The number of retiring employees per title.
-	A list of employees who are eligible to participate in the company’s mentorship program. 

## Results
Using SQL, we were able to organize the Pewlett Hackard’s employee data into tables that identify the employees who are retiring and the employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

The main challenges faced with these tables were:

-	Managing duplicate data caused by promotions/title changes.
-	Filtering the data to only show the employee’s current title. 

After addressing these issues, we were able to determine that:

-	There are 90,398 employees who are getting close to retirement.
-	There are 1,549 employees who are eligible to become mentors. 

Breakdowns of the retirement and mentorship data by title are as follows:


## Summary
According to our analysis, management may futureproof their organization by preparing to fill the 90,398 positions that will be lost to the “silver tsunami” and preparing all eligible employees to become mentors.
